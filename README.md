Add description of what happened each iteration

Iteration 1:
In iteration 1, we attempted to make the deposit, withdraw, user account functions, and ability to have a menu
to see what options you had to withdraw or deposit to the bank account.

The deposit method was given to us, and Larry quickly wrote the withdraw method and the withdraw unit tests
as these methods were essential to the bank account and without them, would make the bank account quite
odd/useless to use. 

Jiabei added the functionality for the user to see different options they had to use in the bank account.
There is the option to deposit, withdraw, and see the bank accounts balance in a way that is pretty easy
for the user to see.

Jiabei also added the functionality for it to detect incorrect options in the bank account (which I guess is not really a functionality
but rather required behavior), and for it to continue allowing you to withdraw or deposit until you exit the bank account program.

Djikstra has created a way for different users to make transactions together, but as we dont have bank accounts implemented yet,
this functionality is not really working, and as such is not included in the options that you will see in the menu.

We were also attempting to add storage of the bank accounts throughout different sessions of using the program,
but that did not end up working
